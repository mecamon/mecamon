##  👋 Hi, my name Carlos Mejía, but my friends call me Meca. Welcome to my humble repository

I am a 2+ years experience software developer, doing mostly web development. I have worked in private, commercial and also governmental projects with plenty of techs.

- 👀 I’m interested in not just learning technologies, but into applying them, hence if you take a deeper look into my Github you will find a bunch of repos with different technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Remix.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people and/or companies looking to solve real problems either for us (developers) or the people in general.
- 📫 If you want to contact me try one of these:
