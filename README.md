##  👋 Hi, my name Carlos Mejía, but my friends call me Meca. Welcome to my humble repository

Former architect (I'm not sure that "former" is the appropiate word, since I still have the degree, but well...) and a 5+ years experience software developer, doing mostly web development. I have worked in private, commercial and also governmental projects with plenty of techs.

- 👀 I’m interested not just learning technologies, but into applying them, hence if you take a deeper look into my Github you will find a bunch of repos with different technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people and/or companies looking to solve real problems either for us (developers) or the people in general.
- 💗 I like reading, videogames, rainy days and architectural visualization.
